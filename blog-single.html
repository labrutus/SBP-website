                        My name is Khizra Ahmad and I’m honored to run to serve as your next Student Body President. As a junior math major, dedicated melanoma researcher, and student leader, the past two and a half years at Carolina have tremendously impacted the way I see the world and have transformed how I see leadership. 
                        </p>

                        <p>
                        My desire to represent UNC students stems from my understanding of injustices in this world, and on this campus. Not having access to equitable resources to succeed in the classroom, struggling to feed yourself while pushing through college, feeling unsupported as a minority student on campus, and lacking funding to create a community for yourself makes Carolina harder than it needs to be. That’s what I’m running to change. 

                        </p>


    
                        <p>
                       Having worked on two student body president campaigns and within student government itself, I witnessed how student self-governance had the potential to transform student’s lives here at Carolina. Throughout my time in student government I helped create the inaugural Investment Advisory Committee to address divestment concerns, assisted with the meal swipe donation plan to fight food insecurity, and addressed the Board of Trustees, alongside former student body president Jaleah Taylor, to promote interfaith unity on campus
                        </p>
    
    
                        <p>
                        My campaign is running on a platform of transparency, unity, and putting student voices first. With the help of Carolina students and my team, we’ve created a policy platform that encompasses all parts of student life: academics, affordability, DEI, civic engagement, sustainability, Greek life, accessibility, and student safety and wellness. Here are our Big Four policies: fighting grade deflation through a grade replacement policy, eliminating food insecurity through installing community fridges in every dorm community, raising marginalized student voices and concerns through an inaugural multicultural council, and increasing funding to student organizations through direct donations from alumni. 

                        </p>
                       <p>
                        Beyond that, I’m an older sister, a dedicated friend, and a math learning assistant on campus. I promise to be a candidate that is here for the students and the communities that they come from. We are all living through times where our safety, sense of self, and identity are being threatened, and now, more than ever, we need someone who will stand firmly for our students and their best interests. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Throughout this campaign, I look forward to hearing from all of you and incorporating student voices throughout the process! Our mission of creating a better future for Carolina starts here, and I need your help to make it our new reality.
                        </p>
